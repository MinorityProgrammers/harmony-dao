Why We Want to Be on Harmony
----------------------------

*   Harmony has shown they are a blockchain that supports social impact and change, with an emphasis on helping marginalized communities
*   Organizations we want to collaborate with are already DAOs on Harmony; Ex; H.E.R. DAO and Africa DAO
*   The Harmony team's energy is fun and inviting, we loved meeting them at EthDenver!
*   Provides real support and guidance for governors to build a scalable and decentralized DAO, as well as support communities like Community DAO
*   EVM compatibility of Harmony, enables us to take existing Solidity based applications we have built, and even existing open-source code, and easily port over to the Harmony ecosystem
*   The founders of Minority Programmers started becoming Degens together doing DeFi on Harmony over a year ago.
*   People have asked us for proposal help and DAO consulting for their organizations, we see this as perfect opportunity to onboard to the Harmony ecosystem, but it is only fitting we go through the formal process first.
*   We want $ONE while it's at a discount

At this stage, we are a functioning **international** organization with **hundreds of members** in every continent of the world and a dozen active staff/advisors, all supported by a functioning DAO on Polygon. We are building out **Genadrop** as an artist creative tool. allowing artists to create and mint generative NFT collections without code through an integrated multichain marketplace. We have also been building out a Career Development dApp, to work in tangent with our DAO so that any minority looking to get a career in STEM has access to local communities, courses, mentors, projects, jobs, and startup investment. Additionally this month, we are set to launch Minority Drop as an initial liquidity event for our DAO and access token to the Genadrop alpha platform. We have provided many OG workshops in the Web3 space, and have onboarded dozens of people across the world to Web3 development through our hackathons and education programs. Our goal at **MPA is to be the most diverse developer network in the blockchain industry, pushing out code, culture, and community.**

  

MPA is looking for funding throughout the Harmony DAO Grants program to support governors as we transition into a DAO, recruit + train engineers through a project-based approach to learning, and support marketing for existing products and services.

# Our Values  / Mandates

The Minority Programmers is building an ecosystem new and diverse talent can be onboarded into a more inclusive internet.

![](https://t4659940.p.clickup-attachments.com/t4659940/56e16649-ed02-453b-83e1-48aaf42202fe/image.png)

*   **Innovation**: open source everything, conversations in the public while we build out the Web3 technology
*   **Diversity and Inclusion**: seek to foster as diverse a membership as possible and support everyone to contribute
*   **Community Building**: Build a self-governed community that is active, constructive and contributing to the betterment of the world.
*   **Mass Adoption**: Onboard every person, every sector, and all technologies to decentralized infrastructure

**ðï¸ Vision**
==============

Minority Programmers to be the go-to inclusive community for onboarding developers across all of the software engineering industry.

**Clear & Concise Mandates**
----------------------------

### **ðï¸ dApp Building**

Building relevant and scalable dapps on the Harmony blockchain that both improve the community with additional users and liquidity, and that are ultimately profitable.

### **ð Recruiting**

Onboard the best talent in the Web3 space to fulfill the industry's talent gap, first being a pipeline for Harmony-funded projects.

### **ð« Team Building**

A critical part of repeatedly delivering on projects is building effective teams. Our project-based (POGIL) approach to learning, uses Agile scrum methodology, to create a tight-knit group of colleagues that can be held accountable for large scale projects

### **ð± Community**

Through IRL events, mentorships, hands-on support, hacker houses, online spaces, etc, we are building a community that both cares about the world and each other. We are creating a safe space for innovation that is inclusive, diverse, chain-agnostic, and is beyond the reach of Web3. Minority Programmers has consistently brought newcomers into the STEM industry building both family and careers

### **ð¤Job Creation**

Whether it is working on projects as founders, providing consultancy work, or placing DAO members in job opportunities, we are focused on building a long-lasting career for those coming into the industry, that they are **_passionate_** about,

### **âð¿ Social Impact**

Building socially impactful solutions. Tech that makes an impact for people across the world, rather than just building tech for tech's sake.

# The Problem

  

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/E8CSodn_D8YVUI5keGgqNMzECJHowFV2nWlKC41Q_X7BWTY-1bJs9WrFg0TWnQsfU7BtofRKX-K3TcRHq0VgiAtpYfM9jAIBCo9X4jzlyrH48nKFeBt8IQZAbIsruxpPFHzCaywj)

  

Lack of diversity, poor inclusion, biased recruitment practices, and lack of appropriate mentorship has continued to afflict the minority community from pursuing STEM as a career choice. This has primarily urged us to come together to provide marginalized communities access to opportunities through events, incubation, education, and capital. We at the Minority Programmers Association banded together after we saw a collection of problems in the workforce, society, and business.

  

**Disparities in STEM Field**Â 
------------------------------

Scientific knowledge is not innate. Diverse perspective and logic is necessary for progression in any field. However, race, gender, socioeconomic disparities continue to distort the growth of technology. Despite the efforts taken to strive for diversity, STEM remains to be one of the least diverse fields. Although the STEM field has the potential to elevate minority populations to financial security, as of 2015, almost half of scientists & engineers in the STEM field were white males.Â 

  

### **Lack of Diversity in the Current STEM Field**

It is estimated that people of color will constitute a majority of the American population in 2050. Not educating people of color in technical fields, would in turn disproportionately offset innovation for Americans in the future, thus leading to a halt in economic growth. As of 2016, **women employed in scientific research and development were less than a third (29.3%)** across the world.Â  Women are grossly underrepresented in the STEM field with just **27% of total STEM** workers in **the USA**.Â  Also, women who hold **bachelor's degrees** in STEM fields are as low as **36%** although overall women graduates are higher in number than men.Â  As of 2015 National Center for Education Statistics, **women of color** accounted for aÂ  low percentage in STEM fields (**2.9% of Black women, 3.6% of Latinax, and 4.8% of Asian women**). At this rate, it might take **76 years** to **achieve equitable representation** of Latinx and Black Engineers in US workforce states [Georgetown Universityâs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/inequitable-access-to-graduate-school-is-holding-back-the-economy-51624300272) Center on Education and the Workforce.Â 

  

Incidentally, **LGBTQ** people have pioneered many scientific advances, but face challenges in STEM that hinder scientific progress and waste human talent. Due to **lack of data from NSF**, as they **donât include SO/GI measures,** researchers **do not have** basic demographic **data** to test **LGBTQ** disparities in STEM 4.Â 

  

Ranging from a variety of reasons it boils down to the fact of feeling like an outsider and not receiving acceptance that scares away high potential talent. Also, the fear of dealing with a male-dominated workforce has also contributed to this unequal participation5.Â 

  

### **Poor Inclusion and Biased Recruitment Practices at the âMost Diverse Companiesâ**

While the STEM industry is spending millions to increase hiring in diverse talent, they are seeing a pipeline problem where much of this STEM talent isnât currently diverse. Even though organizations declare their diversity in hiring and promoting, they have still fallen short in achieving it.

  

_U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for STEM occupation_

| <br>Minority Group<br> | <br>General U.S. Population<br> | <br>Occupied in STEM jobs<br> |
| ---| ---| --- |
| <br>Black/African American<br> | <br>13.4%<br> | <br>9.1%<br> |
| <br>Hispanic/Latino<br> | <br>8.4%<br> | <br>18.5%<br> |
| <br>Women<br> | <br>25.2%<br> | <br>50.8%<br> |

  

The table above shows the data of minority groups from 2020, contrasting the [general population in the U.S.](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/LFE046219)Â  and their proportion in occupying mathematical and computer jobs. It is a well-known fact that the tech field has [lacked diversity](https://www.zippia.com/software-engineer-lead-jobs/demographics/)8 with **80% of software engineers** being **white men** in the U.S. Although the demand for professionals has been steady or even increased (1.2% higher from 2019 to 2020), even through the pandemic, many organizations have held back from hiring.Â 

**Diversity research** by **Harvard Busines**s shows that even larger and more prestigious firms that are committed to diversity inclusion are **companies** that still have **hidden bias** in their hiring strategies. According to their study, most firms believe in **prestigious internships** (Goldman Sachs, Mckinsey, and Google) over a standard internship. This increases socioeconomic bias. Adding to this, **women and minority groups** generally receive **lesser credit** for such internships. 90% of recruiters from such firms boast about diversity, but their resume rating results show that minority and women candidates were always rated lower than white men even with equal GPA.

  

A **Yale University study** shows that, even with a training course, both male and female scientists **preferred to hire men over women9**. Also, they considered them more skilled and also offered them **$4000 more in salary annually**. In a prominent **2004 study of racial bias**, it was tested how a name could make a difference in hiring by sending out 5000 identical resumes under different names. It was found that **white-sounding names** received **50% more job interviews** than others.Â 

  

**Googleâs** organizational commitment towards diversity in hiring eventually did not reinforce their motive. Despite the fact that they pledged to increase black representation in their senior hierarchy and increase their [leadership representation of minority](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/business/google-hbcus/index.html) groups by 30% by 2030, only **3.7%** of their current workforce is **black** and **6%** are **Latino**.

  

**No Sense of Community**
-------------------------

Having a user group where developers meet and discuss their challenges, build skills and also come up with new solutions to solve problems is essential. Such community meetings allow programmers to usually arrive with parallel solutions especially when they have coderâs block, or even skilled individuals to come out of restricted thinking.Â 

  

### **Lack of Mentorship in the minority community**Â 

While it is common for mentees to seek mentors with similar background experience and background, it is observed that minority students often seek mentors of the same race/ethnicity and also find their information to be more helpful.Â  A survey conducted by Strada-Gallup Â in 2018 indicated that only 47% of surveyed minority students preferred their professor to be their mentor. Most of the others, due to stigma consciousness, preferred mentors of the same race, ethnicity and gender.Â 

  

### **Lack of Supportive Environment**

A lack of support creates a very frustrating environment for programmers. This is only emphasized by increased social isolation. Many people who code often know the feeling of stopping in their tracks because of pure frustration and lack of immediate resources for what could very well be a minor bug. Additionally, many programmers describe themselves as introverts, and coincidentally Computer Scientists also appears on lists of good jobs for introverts. While international students provide a unique perspective to problem-solving, American students often perceive them as a threat to the American economy, culture, and education. Additionally, teachers who donât empathize with these linguistic barriers, question competency and at times criticizing their accents further alienating students. This alienation directly translates to weaker performance.Â  While diversity has increased amongst student populations, university faculty and staff remain predominantly caucasian, often adding an additional barrier. The point isnât that people should only learn from people who look like them, in fact, all the evidence weâve provided goes against this. Rather, that the sense of community currently offered isnât in line with the diversity requirement and talent development top tech companies are looking for.Â 

  

### **Untapped potential in Developing Nations**

While there is a lack of STEM in developing nations, we at the Minority Programmers view this as an opportunity to fast track these countries into the IT sector. As â of those in the STEM workforce do not have a college degree, there is an opportunity to bypass the building of resource-intensive infrastructure like brick and mortar generational institutions and disseminate knowledge, mentorships, and experience to those in poverty-stricken communities.Â  This is important as part of the cost associated with education is beyond the physical expense of tuition, room, and board, but the opportunity cost of supporting a family who will potentially lose their immediate income earner as well. The ability to educate families while keeping them close-knit also has the opportunity to combat child labor which affects over 150 million children globally. Pursuing such programs is necessary for fulfilling the future STEM workforce in both Asia and Africa and to prepare students for tech entrepreneurship in the United States. This is key as technological advancement is a substantial indicator of economic growth.Â  Even UNESCO has declared a girlâs access to STEM education as a human right, further emphasizing the impact STEM education has in addressing systemic inequalities in developing countries. While it seems more difficult to achieve in developing nations, in actuality in the past 15 years technological advancement has been growing at a higher rate for developing nations than their developed counterparts.Â 

  

**Lack of Access to Banking and Low Socioeconomic Background**
--------------------------------------------------------------

  

Socioeconomic status continues to be the strongest reason for people to not pursue STEM education around the world. Individuals donât have access to financial services due to lack of financial inclusion. As of 2017, around Â [**1.7 billion people worldwide don't have access to a bank account**](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/lu/Documents/technology/lu-blockchain-accelerate-financial-inclusion.pdf). Students from such poor areas [lack access](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/stem-deserts-in-the-poorest-schools-how-can-we-fix-them/2017/07) to good resources. [Profound example](https://educando.org/education-latin-america/) to this disparity would be Latin America, where the education gap is mirrored by the income gap between rich and poor. 50% of Brazillians, Mexicans and Columbians donât possess the basic ability to solve a simple math equation, while only 1% high income students perform up to the standards of their international peers. In the USA, [low income students canât afford 95% of the colleges](https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/11623/Report_Low-Income_Students_Cannot_Afford_95_Percent_of_Colleges) due to their financial status.Â 

  

It costs around [$65,000 and $80,000 to get a degree in most STEM field](https://studyabroad.careers360.com/articles/engineering-in-usa-know-study-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20studying,could%20be%20above%20%2460%2C000%20annually.)s, while computer science degrees cost $40,000 on an average. More than [56% of college students](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/04/more-than-half-of-students-probably-cant-afford-college-due-to-covid-19.html), due to the pandemic, fear that they can no longer afford college tuition. Nearly 7% of them have already dropped out to pursue full time employment or look for alternative education options. 40% of parents have tapped out their childrenâs college fund to cover their day to day expenses due to economic fallout.

  

According to [Pew Research in 2017](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/17/half-of-americans-think-young-people-dont-pursue-stem-because-it-is-too-hard/) in the USA, 40% of non STEM workers were interested in pursuing a STEM career at some point in their lives, however, **27%** of them stated the **cost of education and time required** as the most common reason to not **choose a STEM career** primarily. Council of Graduate Schools have stated that **82.2%** of enrollment management professionals have noted that **lack of financial support** is the main concern since the **pandemic started.**Â 

  

**Lack of Passion In STEM**
---------------------------

Even with similar enrollment rates, [**1/3rd of minority**](https://eab.com/insights/daily-briefing/student-success/a-third-of-minority-students-leave-stem-majors-heres-why/) students **drop out** of **STEM** degrees, which is nearly twice as much as the white population that dropout of college.Â  Changing majors, and dropping out of college completely are seen as a common trend with minority groups - **black (40%)** and **Latino (37%**) students **switch majors** before earning a degree, while **26% of black** STEM students and **20% of Latino** STEM students **drop out** of college. Although they possess strong interest in the STEM field, a large population of these black and Latino youth come from **low-income families** and **donât have adequate academic resources** that support them through to completion.Â  Given the fact that they **donât drop out** of other competitive fields such as **business** **majors**, it raises **speculation** for a [](https://eab.com/insights/daily-briefing/student-success/a-third-of-minority-students-leave-stem-majors-heres-why/)[**sense of belonging, feeling excluded, discriminated against**](https://eab.com/insights/daily-briefing/student-success/a-third-of-minority-students-leave-stem-majors-heres-why/) or even the anticipation of such feelings. Similarly, a study conducted by **American Educational Research Journal** cited **gender discrimination** to be the **predictive attribute** when women choose their majors.

  

**Lack of Skilled STEM Workers**
--------------------------------

[Talent shortage](https://jobbatical.com/resources/hiring-statistics) is a growing challenge in this digital world. Around **72.8% of employers** have reported that they face **difficulty** in finding **skilled candidates**, and **45% of employers** find itÂ  **difficult** to find employees with **necessary talent**.Â 

  

### **Growth in STEM Field**

Job opportunities in the STEM field are expected to grow over two times in the next decade. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics have predicted over [8% increas](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-10/why-computer-occupations-are-behind-strong-stem-employment-growth.htm#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Labor,3.7%20percent%20for%20all%20occupations.)e in employment for occupation in the STEM field by 2029.Â  Among these, three **occupations** are expected to experience a rapid **growth rate** of 15% or above in the next **decade-** **Information security analysts (31.2%), Software developers, and Computer and information research scientists.**

  

**Growth in Software Developers**

Out of all the STEM occupations, software development is one of the fastest-growing industries in terms of demand. It comprises **64%** of total outsourced or off-shored IT functions worldwide. Averagely, the **software development** **phase** typically takes up to **63% of the total budge**t in new software creation.Â  As of 2015, the USA had around 4.2 million software engineers. Its market is projected to grow at a **CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 4% annually**. As per U.S. Labor Statistics, **employment growth** of software development is expected to **increase** by **21% by 2028**, likely to exceed 27.7 million by 2023. Although in 2020 the job vacancies dropped by 8% due to the pandemic, while senior roles suffered the most shrinking by 11%, as per the [survey conducted by SWZD](https://swzd.com/resources/state-of-it/), **80% of organizations** anticipate the **IT budget to grow** or stay steady over the next **12 months**.

  

### **Gap Between What is Industry Standard & What is Taught in School**

  

One of the biggest challenges that the tech industry faces is the skills gap. Entry-level software developers don't possess skills that are marketable to employers. This stems from the fact that schools aren't at par with the [industry requirement](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236489/skills-learned-school-differ-demanded-work.aspx). [KPMG survey](https://www.td.org/insights/tech-skills-gap-versus-tech-skills-shortage) shows that tech skills shortage is higher than what it was in 2008. Almost 80% of companies are in the process of digital transformation, which increases the demand for new technical skills. However, only [1/5th of the professional](https://www.visualworkforce.com/blog/why-the-skills-gap-is-still-growing) population is up to date with their job-required skills. While 9.22 million people were unemployed in the US in April 2021, there is an estimated 3.5 million jobs that will be needed to be filled by 2025. Not only is this a huge potential to transition underutilized talent into the STEM industry, but individuals are recognizing this labor shortage with over 20% of people in the US reporting to have improved their programming skills since the pandemic.

  

**Covid Has Hurdled Talent Pipeline For Recruiters**

  

Pandemic has reshaped the talent acquisition trends. Companies adopted virtual recruiting, remote candidates, considering internal talent pools, and also focused on diversity, and inclusion.Â 

Regardless of how the pandemic may have affected the hiring, students continue to expect personalized proactive outreach from employers. They look for support and connection with employers through their universities. According to survey data published by job search platform Handshake, [69% of students](https://go.joinhandshake.com/rs/390-ZTF-353/images/Handshake%20Rethinking%20the%20Job%20Search%20in%20the%20Era%20of%20COVID-19.pdf?aliId=eyJpIjoidlRuemNjVTdITFBxOXpjRyIsInQiOiIySjRzRmxCbVhuTlBlczdFU1RWeEl3PT0ifQ%253D%253D) expect their university career center to help them in interactions and communication with employers. Also, **52.2% of students raised concerns** about effectively **communicating virtually** with recruiters.Â 

  

With lesser in face interactions, no careers fairs, recruiters have to turn to remote recruiting options that need to expand geographically. Also, they would need to find new sourcing channels and find ways to engage candidate experience virtually, while still maintaining efficiency and fairness.

  

It can cost up to [$50,000 for a company to recruit and train](https://blog.usejournal.com/it-costs-50k-to-hire-a-software-engineer-d06a0d051abf) a new employee. This cost includes the hiring agency fee, the loss of productivity during the talent search period, the hiring package provided to the recruited talent, and training them. It could take up to [twice the annual salary of an employee to replace them](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/employee-retention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee). This cost is much higher when the hired talent is a replacement for an existing specialist. Losing even a few high performers can affect the companyâs revenue to a large extent.Â 

  

Cost and time factor has influenced recruiters to hire internal candidates. [**Internal hiring**](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/2021-recruiting-trends-shaped-by-covid-19.aspx) [](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/2021-recruiting-trends-shaped-by-covid-19.aspx)has increased by 20% since COVID as per LinkedIn data. Companies are expecting to increase their budget for learning and development to increase, focussing on reskilling or engaging contingent internal talent.

  

### Â **Growth is Not Meeting Demand**

  

As per 2020 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 1.4 million computer science-related job vacancies with only 400,000 computer science graduates to fill them. It is estimated by The American Immigration Council that 20% to 25% of STEM employees in the U.S. are immigrant workers, which is aggravating the talent supply crisis due to the shrinking of the immigrating population. Korn Ferry states that, If the U.S. does not address this talent deficit issue soon enough, it can result in $162 billion in [unrealized](https://www.itexico.com/blog/how-to-handle-the-crisis-of-software-developer-shortage-in-the-u.s) output worth to the economy by 2030.Â 

  

Software development growth is expected to grow 22% by 2029. The demand for blockchain engineers has increased by 517% year after year. With that being said, the U.S. Software market is facing a talent shortage of over 472,000 workers.Â  Global talent shortage has been predicted to go as high as [85.2 million workers,](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/future-of-work) which could lead to a risk of losing $8.4 trillion in revenue due to lack of skilled workers. On the same note, The Economist states that opening the border for talent can increase the global GDP to as high as $78 trillion.

  

**Access to Capital for Minorities**
------------------------------------

[According to the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sbcfac/sbcfac-learn-from-data.pdf), **minorities** only make up **10.7%** of **entrepreneurs** **seeking capital** and also have a **low investment yield rat**e. Additionally, **77%** of **founders** in VC-backed businesses are **white**, only **5.3% of angel investors are minorities**. Moreover, while women-founded companies generate more revenue (and women making a majority of the population), they only constitute 25.9% of entrepreneurs seeking capital (2018) with a lower investment yield rate than minorities.Â  Additionally 71% of VC firms donât even have 1 female partner. Since the onset of the pandemic, women, african, lantinx, and Asian-owned businesses have all been on the decline as well.Â  Women and minorities have far less access to capital and resources than their white male counterparts.

  

**Fragmented Startup Deal Flow**
--------------------------------

Gaining an edge, or an insider advantage is core to the fundamental strategy to the nature of venture capital firms. The earlier a VC Partner is able to spot a potential â[unicorn](https://www.embroker.com/blog/unicorn-startups/)â (a private company valued at or over $1 billion).

  

[**5.6% of U.S. VC firms**](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/your-deal-flow-is-not-diverse-enough/) are led by women, while only 4.9% of VC partners in the U.S. are women.Â  Such studies show that adequate women representation mirrors trusting women's leadership. [McKinsey survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth#:~:text=How%20advancing%20women's%20equality%20can%20add%20%2412%20trillion%20to%20global%20growth,-September%201%2C%202015&text=A%20McKinsey%20Global%20Institute%20report,gaps%20in%20work%20and%20society.) states that Global GDP can increase upto $28 trillion globally if gender equality was achieved. [United Nations study](https://www.unescap.org/resources/economic-and-social-survey-asia-and-pacific-2007) shows that the Asia-Pacific region (like China and USA), are losing upto $42 billion in GDP annually due to not fully engaging womenâs participation in their economy.Â 

**Minority Tech founders are being overlooked**

  

Minority founders remain as [**untapped potentia**](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/untapped-opportunity-minority-founders-still-being-overlooked/)[l](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/untapped-opportunity-minority-founders-still-being-overlooked/) in the technology field. As reported in a recent study by RateMyInvester and DiversityVC, **77.1%** of **founders** are **generally white**, no matter their gender or their education.Â  **Asians** were found to be the second highest with **17.7%** of **VC funding**. **Black founders** who have venture capital support are **less than 1%**. **1.8%** of **Latino** founders are funded while **Middle-Easterners** stood at **2.8%**. Moreover, [Black and Latino founders](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3584734/minority-tech-startups-in-the-us-have-seen-almost-no-progress-in-vc-funding.html) have found difficulty in securing VC funding in the last **7 years** receiving just **2.4%** VC investments. By **2020**, this figure just saw a **rise** of **0.2%.**Â 

  

[Angel and seed deal decline](https://askwonder.com/research/minority-start-up-founders-research-n52ic53fw) - It is reported that **women** comprise 29.5% **of angel investors** and **11% of VC** , while **minorities** take up only **5.3% of angel investors.** A 2019 [Kauffman Foundation](https://www.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/capital_access_lab_exec_summary_FINAL.pdf) study stated that **women**, while pitching the same business content as men, were **less likely to** **secure funding**. Also, while men were usually questioned about growth-related gains, women were questioned about non-losses.

  

### **COVID has severely fractured the venture capital world**

  

The Venture Capital investment landscape has declined since the pandemic hit. In **2020**, there was a **44% decrease in deals** made in the **seed to Series B stages**. Startups are facing a crisis with early-stage funding decreasing, as investors are on edge due to pandemic crises and economic uncertainty. In addition to that, the absence of in-person meetings with investors, an important deciding factor for early-stage investing further delays the process. For **new ventures**, usually, initial capital is raised through **seed-stage funding**, however, this has **decreased** by [](https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-funding-dwindles-due-to-coronavirus-slowdown-11585175702)[**22%**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-funding-dwindles-due-to-coronavirus-slowdown-11585175702) [since early 2020](https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-funding-dwindles-due-to-coronavirus-slowdown-11585175702). This might directly end up in loss of talent as skilled employees may end up getting laid off due to macroeconomic reasons.Â  Indirectly larger organizations will also be affected as such startups that are usually acquired (as R&D) for product diversification, or market penetration will be lost. Alternatively, larger firms have also taken advantage of this compressed valuations to acquire companies at a cheaper price. (unsure if to write about corp minority investments as large tech firms have moved towards it)Â 

  

On the other hand, COVID has only exacerbated the difficulty of finding viable startups for venture capital backing. A month into the pandemic, First Republic Bank, found after surveying hundreds of Silicon valley firms, that [**â of VCs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c-pQdaYo9Gl1XUEYHg6R-PYPY5GGG6tcrVhJVm4KUDI/edit#) refused to make investments without meeting the founders face to face, resulting in fewer overall investments.Â

# Path to Sustainability

ð³ï¸ **Why We Want to DAO**
==========================

Our main motivation for creating a DAO

*   A central dashboard for newcomers to look at and understand what is happening to the organization as a whole
*   Move funds away from the custody of the Minority Programmers administrators and into the people
*   Delegate funds (payouts, grant money, investment) in a programmatic way with a clear audit trail and no single point of failure (especially with Multi-sig wallet)
*   Making an official name in the Web3 space. We are already building all our applications with some form of Web3 infrastructure, coming up with in-house applications, consulting, doing NFT drops, organizing Web3 hackathons, all day everyday. Transitioning to complete DAO lets the world know we are officially a Web3 organization.
*   Serving as an on-chain resume for the work and reputation of members
*   Streamline into reputation-based system to incentivize users to be later integrated into career development dApp
*   Providing early use case for Web3 organization transitioning to Web3, then transitioning to a DAO
*   Support from mentors in the space through formal organizations (Harmony, Snapshot, Aragon)
*   Streamline talent sourcing, hiring, onboarding, in a decentralized manner rather than the traditional recruiter model

  

ðµ The Path Towards Decentralization
====================================

Just like any network, the inital ecosystem starts out relatively centralized and moves toward a path to decentralization.

  

We have outlined the following steps to making Minority Programmers increasingly decentralized.

  

1.  Lower initial barrier to entry to governance voting by making governance token 1 USDC and then doing dollar giveaways providing customer support onboarding each user
2.  Hiring Staff Across the World, need more exposure in Latin America, Asia, and Europe
3.  Creating MPA Chapters, Continental, National, Regional, Statewide, Citywide, and Schoolwide to create a group of leaders in each respective zone and pave the way for sub-DAOs. (Chapter Dashboard and Map in the works for the dApp)
4.  Utilization of gasless governance systems in Discord like Aragon Witnet, allowing voting of proposals through emojis
5.  Cross-chain approach to dApp building to avoid groupthink
6.  Putting those from other organizations in key positions at MPA, like H.E.R. DAO as a governor role
7.  Institute NFT reputation badges for DAO contributions that give access to elevated roles and exclusive perks
8.  Using a diverse set of recruitment funnels
9.  Translating documents and localizing dApps in order to be accessible to ESL users (incentivizing through reputation in DAO)
10.  Providing scholarships through the DAO
11.  Hook up treasury into DAO
12.  Providing low-cost and free educational materials and programs
13.  Teaming up with H.E.R. DAO on connectivity projects to onboard those onto DAO that normally would not have access to the internet let alone Web3.

  

  

  

ð Our Own Personal Pain Points
===============================

*   People are having a hard time understanding everything we are doing
*   Changing markets in Web3 are causing us to pivot rapidly
*   Many unicorn-like ideas get lost in the backlog because our developer pool is tied up, need or a dedicated rapid R&D department dedicated to Web3
*   Payroll is tedious and involves token allocation

  

ðð» Downside of DAOs
=====================

From participating in DAOs, to being involved in international grassroots organizing, we are well aware of the pitfalls of DAOs.

*   It is hard to keep DAO members informed
*   Not enough people in a DAO vote in DAO, low participation
*   Cultural misalignment due to stakeholder conflicting views
*   Lack of legal precedence and unclear legal jurisdiction for international DAOs
*   Human and business decisions can be complex are hard to code within current frameworks

### What Is Lacking In the industry

Here are some critical things we are considering when looking at DAOs. As a cross-chain Web3 community, we are urging that we build this DAO tooling so we can pave the way for onboarding all communities into some form of DAO infrastructure.

  

#### Cross Chain DAO tools

We receive grant allocations and payments across multiple chains, and there is no DAO tool that has fund delegation across multiple chains.

#### Communication Tools

Often DAOs today are forums with bad UI. Rather DAOs need to have tailored communication and notification systems that keep members engaged and informed.

#### Reputaiton based incentivizaiton systems

Rather than simply being impacted by the decisions that are made by a DAO, individuals need to be incentivized to continue to contribute towards DAOs because they are gaining "reputation" within a system that translates into tangible benefits. This reputation needs to be linked to someone's DID/wallet

#### The Gamification of DAO

Aside from reputation, DAOs need to be gamified, not only feel knowledged of the processes of a DAO but are fully immersed in the internal ecosystem that makes each DAO unique.

#### Role-Based Privileges

Just like in normal businesses, different roles have access to different decision processes. DAO's need to represent the elevated privileges and open up decisions to these roles.

#### Encryption for Enterprise

Although DAO's are commonly used as an audit trail, with complete organizational transparency; for many enterprise-grade organizations; there are decisions that members would want to vote on democratically, but not show on-chain due to the sensitive nature of the information. There is a need for DAO infrastructure that maintains privacy, so enterprise-level businesses can maintain corporate confidentiality and competitive advantage.

#### Legal Frameworks

Since DAOs often are international and don't see any borders, there is little legal precedence. When there is legal precedence, let's say in the case of Wyoming's recognition of DAO's under the LLC status, there is little compliance infrastructure that is encompassed on the application level. Additionally, many dApps lack compliance infrastructure for NFTs and tokenization, assets that are often held a delegated by DAO's. It is also unclear if DAO members take liability associated with their organization. This has real implications, as DAO's find themselves needed to get fiat to handle IRL expenses, hence needing formalized legal structures.

#### Custodial Solution

Often DAOs either have a multi-sig wallet that is controlled by "governors" or the equivalent centralized body that first piloted the DAO or funds are tied directly to the votes of DAO token holders. However, a multi-sig wallet only requests approval for transactions from a minimum number of wallets associated with the multi-sig wallet, There needs to be complex tooling that allows amendments and comments to multisig transactions.

#### Hiring & Payroll

Now many DAOs are even getting into relationships with talent like developers and needed to do the vetting process through the DAO as well as payroll. There also poses the risk of revealing sensistive informantion about the talent, and legal implications of hiring employee and contractors.

# Minority World Metaverse

**Building an equitable metaverse for all: Minority World**

  

We were recently looking at metaverse land to start a community for minorities to educate each other on Web3 and to really just have a safe space for interdisciplinary expression. Now, searching for land in the Web3 metaverse on [Decentraland from price low to high](https://market.decentraland.org/lands?assetType=nft&section=land&isMap=false&isFullscreen=false&vendor=decentraland&page=1&sortBy=cheapest&onlyOnSale=true&viewAsGuest=false) we can see that the **cheapest parcel** is 4,970 MANA (currently $2.95 as of 1/17/2022) = **$14,661.50.** And this is in a far out property, equivalent to the hood or middle of nowhere in the metaverse. To afford a space in the âmetropolitanâ of Decentraland it can cost at least **$25,000**

![](https://t4659940.p.clickup-attachments.com/t4659940/5c2318cb-9e83-4398-ab90-baa371c6e1a4/image.png)

![](https://t4659940.p.clickup-attachments.com/t4659940/216a4392-90e5-427c-a26a-104ae4766b36/image.png)

  

Weâve been meeting with a lot of other leaders in the space that represent under-represented communities and we think it's messed up that a parcel in Decentraland is more than some property in the real world, and [ETH gas fees](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) are more than filing fees. We see this as modern class-ism and especially further marginalizing communities who do not have access to becoming early adopters in Web3 and digital financial capital. Forcing future metaverse users to be consumers to the Web3 elitist class. Considering weâve been planning to use our future NFT drop as access tokens for communities in the metaverse, we need to start buying land now before the digital housing market moons ðð. Together, we can crowdfund this article, share ownership, and create a decentralized neighborhood meant for the people who need Web3 the most and a space to express culture, art, technology, and education.

  

  

  

We are asking for 20 ETH in order to

*   â°ï¸ Buy a parcel accounting for a price increase
*   ð« Hire Instructors to Teach Web3
*   ð¼ï¸ Pay for 3D Designers and Developers to build out plot
*   ð¤Sponsoring other communities into Minority World
*   â½ Gas fees (Ex; Swapping to Mana, Airdropping Tokens)

  

For those who fund this endeavor more than $1,000 get exclusive access to the MinorityWorld land.Â

# Ideas For dApps

_We are big on project based learning, so here are some ideas for dApps that we would love to see others build out!_

*   Mirror XYZ on Harmony
*   Mintcord - Mint NFTs without leaving discord
*   DAOggregate
*   DAOfind - DAO Aggregator
*   Party Listen - split music into tracking NFTs and only being able to listen once all NFT holders approve a Listen Party
*   AsylumDAO
*   Tokenizing each member of a DAO and then making a index token based on relative contribution to represent overall price and governance of DAO

# Financials

In this section of the proposal we cover

*   The Governors ([https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-1940/f67494134f17a47/4e6q4-1220](https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-1940/f67494134f17a47/4e6q4-1220))- our governors their experience, salary and time commitments
*   Funding Proposal ([https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-1940/f67494134f17a47/4e6q4-1300](https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-1940/f67494134f17a47/4e6q4-1300))- our itemized budget for 6 months
*   Revenue Models ([https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-1940/f67494134f17a47/4e6q4-1487](https://doc.clickup.com/d/h/4e6q4-1940/f67494134f17a47/4e6q4-1487))- our revenue models and how we plan on becoming profitable

# The Governors

The following Governors for the most part are already existing exec, advisors, and staff at the Minority Programmers Association and have been so for around a year. These governor roles would indicate a formalized salary raise. Additionally, many of these governor positions are for people actively in Africa, as we believe we should put the communities in the most need in positions of power, and that competitive wages should be a priority when bringing those from marginalized communities into the Web3 space.

\=================================================================

  

  

Governors shall be reelected every 3 months with a monthly payroll. Every payroll should be given as a Harmony Forum update with the TX of the transactions outlined.

### Â Removal & Replacement of a Governor

The intent of this DAO is to execute the matters of Minority Programmers in a faster manner than Web2.

  

With these efforts being time-sensitive, it is imperative that all DAO governors and ambassadors perform their duties and contribute in a fair and equitable manner.

Should the panel of governors feel a fellow governor or ambassador is not contributing equally, a discussion will be had in a group session. If that governor or ambassador continues to fall behind in quality contributions, a vote will be taken to remove and replace said, governor or ambassador. The vote will be done in a private chat with all governors present, and require at least a 60% vote in favor of removal. Votes and documentation can be made available to the public if requested.

  

  

**Bonus System**

Based on substantial evidence of over-achievement and testimony from other DAO members, governors can receive bonuses. Bonuses must be written as a forum on Minority Programmers DAO on Snapshot

# Funding Proposal

Minority Programmers is requesting $275,000 for 6 months of governor salary, application development, and in-real-life events. We are already operating as a business with these roles existing, funding by harmony will allow for the guaranteed salary of pivotal roles for scaled application development

|  | MONTHLY | 6 months |  |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| ITEM | COST ($) | COST ($) | BUDGET JUSTIFICATION |
| Governors | 30,000 | 180,000 | Based on 9 governors committing a total 100 hours = 400 hours a month \* 75. Includes staffing |
| Hackathons |  | 35,000 | 2Â  pop up hacker houses |
| Meetups |  | 12,000 | 6 x Meetups (3 x 50 person andÂ  2 x 20 person, 1 x virtual) (mostly in Miami) |
| Conference |  | 8,000 | Travel and Accommodation \* |
| Marketing |  | 30,000 | Professional PR, Adverts, Giveaways, Events, promotion on NFT Drops |
| Legal and Accounting |  | 10,000 | Legal services, consulting, immigration and accounting. |
| TOTAL |  | 275,000 |  |

_$275,000 for 6 months, $1 million over 2 years for continued onboarding, diversity, and dApp building initiatives_

# Revenue Models

_Despite being a decentralized organization centered around onboarding marginalized communities into the space, we still need to continue to be profitable in order to sustainably scale. Fortunately, there are so many ways to get paid._

  

ð¡ Token Model
--------------

With the launch of $MINORITY token, as the value of the token goes up, then the overall value of the development, marketing, and treasury allocations also increases.

ð Launchpad Model
------------------

For startups coming through our incubator program, we will take a % allocation of total token supply.

ð Marketplace/AMM Model
------------------------

For dApps we are taking a marketplace or market maker tax. For ex; on Genadrop we take a 10% minting fees for collections minted through our platform, a number we will toggle as the market warrants it in the space.

ð Grant Model
--------------

A model we are using right now. Appealing to blockchain foundations and Web3 protocols ecosystem growth allocations to fund the delivery of new projects ideas, unlocking based on fulfilling milestones on outlined criteria.

ðª NFT Drop Model
-----------------

For specific NFT drops the Minority Programmers consults, developers, or markets for we take a percentage of mint sales, royalties, and upfront capital.

ð¼ Consultancy
--------------

For projects that we do for clients, we take fiat and token payments upfront and the rest on completion. For Web3 projects, often a portion allocated for the development of the token supply is also given to minority programmers.

â»ï¸ Subscription-Based Models
----------------------------

For exclusive services, like access to IRL events or advanced education, we will be using subscription-based payment both fiat and smart contract-based as another revenue stream.

ð Fund Model
-------------

For Minority Venture Capital, the fund manager takes a 20% carry based on profits from each monthly crystallization period.

ð VC Model
-----------

After our products scale, using traditional equity agreements or [SAFT agreements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-agreement-future-tokens-saft.asp) for token equity, we can sell a stake of our products to get additional funding.

ð¥ Content Creation Model
-------------------------

Through the creation of educational content through companies like Metamask, or Figment's Builder DAO, we can get paid for creating the educational content we were already going to create.

ð Sponsorship Model
--------------------

For hackathons and events, we get funded to facilitate this event and conduct marketing and different level of sponsorship tiers. For ex; DeFiSummer gold package = $5,000 Sponsorship.

ð¥ Talent Sourcing Model
------------------------

For effectively recruiting, vetting, and placing talent in corporate jobs, we get cash incentivizes and a percentage based on the overall salary for that recruit (negotiated with partner company)

ð±ï¸ Ad Model
------------

A traditionally less profitable model, but something we can use even in a Web3 way with services like Adex, we gain revenue from click-through impressions on our websites and dApps.

ð Onramp/Offramp Model
-----------------------

Using 3rd party integrations; For ex; Moonpay, we gain a fee for integrating onnramping and offramping solutions into our existing dApps, both channeling an additional revenue stream, and improving the user flow for our product experiences.

ð¬ Referral Model
-----------------

For referring users to corporate affiliate links. For example; the Coinbase affiliate program, we can passively generate income through referral links.

ð¨âð» The Hungry Coder Model
----------------------------

Sometimes our devs and staff miss learning and hitting the trenches, so we compete in hackathons and complete bounties, and win prizes. Not very profitable at all, but leads to projects that get grants and then eventual VC funding, as well as training for our budding developers and a filter for our talent sourcing model.
